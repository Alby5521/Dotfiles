# Requirements

← **Previous section**: [Index](../README.md)

Dotfiles are designed for Arch Linux distributions, if you need to use it in another distribution, you will need to modify some settings and the installer, like the package manager used. They are designed for a 14 inches laptop with an Italian keyboard layout. Probably you will need to modify some keybindings and some settings, like screen resolution, to adapt their for your configuration.

I recommend to use the installer in a fresh installation of Arch Linux. I also recommend to install Arch Linux using Archinstall tool with settings recommended in the next section.

> [!WARNING]

> For Invidia GPU users, could be necessary to install the proprietary drivers for the GPU, and add some configurations. You can find alla the information in the [Hyprland wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/) section dedicated to the Nvidia GPU and on the [Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA) section dedicated to the Nvidia GPU.
